# ft_containers
The multiple available containers in C++ all have a very different usage. Understand them all, let's re-implement them!

In this project, you will implement a few container types of the C++ standard template
library.
You have to take the structure of each standard container as reference. If a part of
the Orthodox Canonical form is missing in it, do not implement it.
As a reminder, you have to comply with the C++98 standard, so any later feature of
the containers MUST NOT be implemented, but every C++98 feature (even deprecated
ones) is expected.

Implement the following containers and turn in the necessary <container>.hpp files:
  
â€¢ vector
  
You donâ€™t have to do the vector<bool> specialization.
  
â€¢ map
  
â€¢ stack
  
It will use your vector class as default underlying container. But it must still be compatible with other containers, the STL ones included.

 You also have to implement:
  
â€¢ iterators_traits
  
â€¢ reverse_iterator
  
â€¢ enable_if
  
Yes, it is C++11 but you will be able to implement it in a C++98 manner. This is asked so you can discover SFINAE.
  
â€¢ is_integral
  
â€¢ equal and/or lexicographical_compare
  
â€¢ std::pair
  
â€¢ std::make_pair
